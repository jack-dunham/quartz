An **isometric tensor network state (isoTNS)** is a generalisation of the canonical form of a [[matrix product state]] (MPS) to higher dimensions, with the fundamental difference that these higher dimensional generalisations are *approximate*---while every MPS can be gauged into an isometric form, that is not the case in general for a [[project entangled pair state]] (PEPS). As such, the set of isometric PEPS (isoPEPS) are a subset of PEPS, and thus are less expressible ansatze. The isoTNS ansatz was first introduced in Ref. [[@Zaletel2020]] along with a 2D version of the [[time-evolving block decimation]] algorithm (TEBD$^2$) applied to the [[transverse field ising model]]. In a subsequent paper, a 2D version of the [[density matrix renormalisation group]] algorithm (DMRG$^{2}$) was introduced with an additional application to the Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice [[@Lin2021]].
