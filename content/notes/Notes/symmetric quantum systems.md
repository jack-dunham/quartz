## Abelian groups
Suppose a hamiltonian $H$ is symmetric with respect to an abelian group $\mathcal{G}$ with group elements $g \in \mathcal{G}$. That is, suppose
$$
U(g) H \,U^{\dagger}(g) = H \quad \forall g \in \mathcal{G}
,$$
where $U(g)$ is a unitary representation of $g \in \mathcal{G}$. Then the Hilbert space of $H$ decomposes into a direct sum of invariant subspaces of the group $\mathcal{G}$. That is, from the perspective of $\mathcal{H}$ being the representation space of the representation $U$, we can write $\mathcal{H}$ as a direct sum of invariant subspaces.  

For $\ket{\psi_{l}} \in \mathbb{V}^{l}$, the group generator $j \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is the operator such that
$$
j\ket{\psi_{l}} = l\ket{\psi_{l}}
$$
